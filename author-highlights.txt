In this paper, we have surveyed the many important aspects of
scheduling problems in cloud computing. After introducing the needed
terminology, we presented a comprehensive taxonomy of the different
cloud scheduling approaches and issues. A layered and phased
scheduling model is presented that differentiates the concerns between
infrastructure, platform, servers and function as a service models. A
comprehensive investigation has been conducted to verify that the
taxonomy is valid and that existing scheduling techniques motivate its
validity.
